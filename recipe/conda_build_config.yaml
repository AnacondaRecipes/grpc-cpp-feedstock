# In Linux, absl-cpp is built on all platforms with C++17's features
# enabled.  Specifically, absl::string_view is a typedef/alias of
# std::string_view. Calling a function that uses absl::string_view
# when the standard is below C++17 will result in a link time error
# (undefined reference).
#
# gcc8's support for C++17 is still considered experimental, use a
# newer version where available.
